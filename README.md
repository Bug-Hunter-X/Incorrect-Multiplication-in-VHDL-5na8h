# Incorrect Multiplication in VHDL

This repository contains a VHDL code example demonstrating an incorrect multiplication operation between two 8-bit vectors.  The code attempts to multiply two 8-bit unsigned inputs (a and b) and output a 16-bit product (prod).  However, the multiplication operation is incorrectly implemented, leading to an incorrect result.

The `bug.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.vhdl` file provides a corrected version that uses the correct multiplication operation in VHDL.  This example highlights the importance of understanding VHDL's built-in operators and data type handling for accurate results.
